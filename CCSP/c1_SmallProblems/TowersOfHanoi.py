    The Tower of Hanoi consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.
    The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top,
    thus making a conical shape.

    The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

        - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
        - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of
            the stacks and placing it on top of another stackor on an empty rod.
        - No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

    With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves.
    The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
