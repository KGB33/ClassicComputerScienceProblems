1. ___Small Problems___
    1. _Fibonacci Sequence_
        > Calculating the Fibonacci Sequence using various techniques such as 
        recursion, memoization, iteration and generators.
        
    1. _Trivial Compression_
        > Compressing genes by storing the eight bit String Nucleotides ('A', 'C','G' or, 'T')
        as a two bit bit-string (0b00 to 0b11). 
    
    1. _Unbreakable Encryption_
        > Encrypts by XORing a data bit-string with random
        bit-string of the same length. 
    
    1. _Calculating Pi_
        > A Conversion of the Leibniz formula into Python.
        
    1. _Towers of Hanoi_
        > Uses Stacks and recursion so solve the Towers of Hanoi
        problem for 3 towers and 3 rings
        
    1. _Exercises_
        1. A conversion of the Fast-Doubling Fibonacci Algorithm to Python.
            > It takes about 0.25us to get the 10,000th Fibonacci Number.
        1. A wrapper to compress a stream of characters into a bit-string.
            > Uses @property for ease of use and is iterable.
     
1. ___Search Problems___
    1. _DNA Search_
        > Searches for a Codon within a Gene using Linear and Binary Search. 
    
    1. _Maze Solving_
        > Generate, then solve a random maze using Depth-First, Breadth-First and, A* Search
    
    1. _Missionaries and Cannibals_
        > Encode, then solve the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle using 
        Depth-First, Breadth-First and, A* Search
    
    1. _Exercises_
        1. Compares Binary Search and Linear Search performance.
            >  Uses a 1,000,000 element list. Both sorted and unsorted.
        1. Compares Depth-First, Breadth-First and, A* Search on for Maze Solving
            > Counts the average number of nodes each search visited for 200 mazes.
       
1. ___Constraint Satisfaction Problems___
    1. _Building the CSP Framework_
        > A Generalized Constraint Satisfaction Problem Framework with a backtracking search.
        As well as ABC for constraints.
    
    1. _Map Coloring_
         > Colors the seven Australian provinces such that
         no two adjacent provinces have the same color.
         
    1. _Eight Queens_
        > Positions eight Queens such that no Queen can attack another.
    
    1. _Word Search_
        > Positions several words in a grid such that there is no overlap.
    
    1. _SEND+MORE=MONEY_
        > Finds what digits to replace the letters such that the equation
        holds true.
      
    1. _Exercises_
        1. _Circuit Board Layout_
            > Fit different sized NxM rectangles into an AxB rectangle.
        1. _Suduku Solver_
            > Solves Suduku Puzzles, albeit very slowly. The more clues provided the faster it is.
            (17 Clues --> 32 hours, 36 Clues --> 5s)
